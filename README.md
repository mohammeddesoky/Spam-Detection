* **Overview**

This project is designed to detect whether a given message or email is spam or not using various machine learning algorithms. The project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text data and multiple machine learning models to classify the messages. The final application includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter for ease of use.

* **Features**

-Message Classification:Classify messages as spam or not spam.

-Multiple ML Algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression,

-Graphical User Interface: User-friendly GUI for inputting messages and displaying results.

* **Technologies Used**

Programming Language: Python Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), XGBoost, Tkinter (for GUI),
